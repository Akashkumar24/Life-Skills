# Tiny Habits Reflection

## 1. Anchor Habits
The idea of "anchor habits" stood out. Attaching new habits to existing routines, like flossing one tooth after brushing, makes habit formation simple and natural.

## 2. B = MAP Framework
B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt:
- Motivation: Desire to act.
- Ability: Simplicity of the action.
- Prompt: Reminder or trigger.

To make habits easier:
- Ensure prompts are clear.
- Simplify the tasks.
- Build on existing motivation.

## 3. Importance of Celebration
Celebrating after a habit reinforces positive emotions and helps the habit stick. Examples include:
- Smile or say "I did it!"
- Do a small fist pump or happy dance.

## 4. Compounding Improvements
Small daily improvements compound over time. A 1% improvement every day can lead to transformational changes.

## 5. Identity and Habits
Habits are tied to identity. Instead of focusing on outcomes, strive to become the person who embodies the behavior you want. For example:
- "I am a reader" instead of "I want to read more."

## 6. Making Habits Easier
- Simplify: Remove unnecessary steps.
- Two-minute rule: Start small, like "write one sentence" instead of "write a book."
- Environment design: Arrange surroundings to reduce barriers.

## 7. Making Habits Harder
- Increase friction: Add steps between you and the habit.
- Remove triggers: Eliminate cues that prompt the behavior.
- Commitment devices: Set rules or barriers to prevent the habit.

## 8. New Habit: Daily Meditation
Steps to build the habit:
- Make cue obvious: Place a cushion in a visible spot.
- Make it attractive: Reward yourself with tea afterward.
- Make it easy: Start with just two minutes.
- Make it satisfying: Celebrate by saying, "Iâ€™m proud of myself."

## 9. Breaking a Habit: Scrolling Social Media Before Bed
Steps to eliminate the habit:
- Make cue invisible: Keep the phone out of the bedroom.
- Make it unattractive: Reflect on how it affects sleep.
- Make it hard: Use apps to block access during bedtime.
- Make it unsatisfying: Journal how good sleep improves your mood and energy.
